#  My First HTML Project

Welcome to my very first HTML project! 
This project is mainly built for **practice purposes**, where I explored the basic structure and different tags in HTML.

---

##  What I Practiced and Implemented

- Basic HTML page structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
- Text formatting tags like:
  - `<b>`, `<strong>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, `<br/>`, `<hr>`
- Lists:
  - Ordered Lists (`<ol>`)
  - Unordered Lists (`<ul>`)
- Images:
  - Using `<img>` with `src`, `alt`, `width`, `height`, and `title`
- Tables:
  - Simple tables with `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, `<th>`
  - Merging cells with `colspan` and `rowspan`
- Form Elements:
  - Text input, Email input, Telephone input
  - Radio buttons and Checkboxes
  - File upload input
  - Password fields
  - Drop-downs (`<select>`, `<optgroup>`, `<option>`)
  - Textarea for messages
- Advanced HTML5 Inputs:
  - Number, Date, Time, Week, Month, Color Picker, URL, Range Slider
- Using `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` to group form elements
- Simple nesting of `<div>` elements for basic structure

---

##  Key Highlights

- **Forms**: I designed two forms â€” one for general enquiries and one showcasing HTML5 input types.
- **Tables**: Built a simple calendar structure for May 2024.
- **List Types**: Practiced with different list styles (`type="a"` for ordered list and `type="circle"` for unordered list).
- **Semantic Elements**: Used headings `<h1>` to `<h5>`, paragraphs `<p>`, and more.
- **Validation**: Added some basic HTML validations like `pattern`, `title`, and input types.

##  Image Used

- An image of **Shree Krishna** with a fallback `alt` text if the image fails to load.

---

##  Notes and Corrections

- A small typo: `<ol>` and `<ul>` were mixed; remember that ordered and unordered lists should be closed correctly.
- `<p>` tag should not wrap `<h5>`. Headings and paragraphs should be separated.
- Instead of using `<button>` for radio options, only `<input type="radio">` should be used.
- Minor spelling mistakes like "cource" should be "course", "enquiery" should be "enquiry", "glarray" should be "gallery", etc.

*(But that's totally fine â€” it's the first step and it's a great effort! ðŸŽ¯)*

##  What I Learned from This Project

- Building the basic skeleton of an HTML page
- Handling form inputs and validation
- Creating tables and calendars
- Using semantic and non-semantic tags
- Small details that matter in real HTML development

---

##  Future Improvements

- Fix form label and input alignments.
- Make the website more responsive using basic CSS.
- Correct small HTML syntax errors for better structure.
- Add a little styling to make it visually more appealing.

##  Conclusion

This project marks the beginning of my web development journey.  
I'm excited to continue learning and improving!  
Every line of code here represents a step toward becoming better at front-end development. ðŸ™Œ
